 * These are the settings needed for the Kubos Software Update/Recovery system.
 * Everything defined here is expected to be common to all boards. There are some
 * options that must be defined in the board's configuration file because they are
 * not guaranteed to be portable:
 *
 * - DFU_ALT_INFO_MMC - Defines the files/partitions which may be replaced in MMC
 *                      storage
 * - DFU_ALT_INFO_NOR - Same as above, but for NOR flash storage
 * - CONFIG_SYS_DFU_DATA_BUF_SIZE - File transfer chunk size (for raw or file transfer. EXT4, FAT, etc)
 * - CONFIG_SYS_DFU_MAX_FILE_SIZE - Max size for a single file (partition transfer)
